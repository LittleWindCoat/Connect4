 Intro to AI Game Playing

The project was written in Java. There are a total of 8 classes.

The main method is in the Main.java class.

Project was built with Eclipse.

Instructions for the player are displayed. We implemented the random walk for all boards. However, the Minimax player 
and Minimax AlphaBeta player only works for the standard 6x7x4 board. The H-minimax was also not implemented.

The token color for the player is always red, and the computer plays yellow. 
The user gets to choose whether he/she wants to go first or not.
